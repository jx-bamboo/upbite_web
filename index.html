      <p><h3 >Introduction</h3>
      </p>
      The Upbite Alliance is an organization that connects digital asset exchanges around the world, aiming to
      seamlessly aggregate the overall liquidity and depth
      of global digital assets and build a network of weakly
      centralized alliances.In August 2019, the upbite
      alliance was formally established,and consensus has
      been reached on three exchanges across regions,
      cultures and time. The first one is the WOEx exchange,
      who has obtained the US msb license, which is issued
      and supervised by the US Treasury; the second one is
      the European exchange Alt-coin, which is licensed by
      the Estonian government; and the third one is the
      Australian agdaex exchange, has obtained the
      Australian government license.Upbite is currently
      actively expanding the scope of the alliance, and it is
      expected that two licensed exchanges will join the
      alliance at the end of the year.

        </div>
        The Upbite Exchange Alliance Eco-Certification, referred
        to as “WTA”, was issued jointly by the exchanges in the
        Upbite Alliance, with a total amount of 2.979 billion, and
        guaranteed never to be issued. WTA can realize free
        conversion and circulation within the alliance, share the
        depth of trading on all major platforms, and more
        effectively provide sufficient transaction liquidity,
        and transactions can be circulated in a timely and
        efficient manner. WTA will be given more usage scenarios,
        such as community incentives, fee deductions, community
        node rewards, and more.
        We look forward to and welcome more partners to join the
        Upbite Alliance in the future.
